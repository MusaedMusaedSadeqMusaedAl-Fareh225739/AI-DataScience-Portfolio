# Cleaned EV Adoption Data

## Overview
This dataset is part of the **EV Adoption Visualization** project, which investigates strategies to promote the affordability and accessibility of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Netherlands. The data focuses on key factors such as income distribution, EV pricing, government incentives, and environmental impact. It was meticulously collected, cleaned, and processed to ensure accuracy and usability.

## Purpose
The cleaned dataset aims to:
- Support insights into EV affordability and adoption rates.
- Provide actionable data for policymakers, researchers, and businesses.
- Highlight the environmental and economic impacts of EV adoption in alignment with **Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7)**.

## Why This Data Was Collected
The dataset was created to address the research question:

**"How can businesses in the Netherlands promote affordable and sustainable EV adoption among individuals within Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7)?"**

Key objectives:
1. **Understand Affordability**:
   - Explore the relationship between income levels and EV ownership.
2. **Analyze Policy Impact**:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of government incentives in driving EV adoption.
3. **Assess Environmental Benefits**:
   - Highlight the role of EVs in reducing CO2 emissions.

## How the Data Was Collected

### **Sources**
1. **National Statistical Reports**:
   - Regional income levels, EV prices, and adoption rates.
2. **Government Policy Data**:
   - Tax reliefs, subsidies, and other incentive programs.
3. **Environmental Data**:
   - CO2 emissions and renewable energy contributions.
4. **Survey Data**:
   - Public sentiment on EVs, collected through Google Forms.
5. **Online APIs**:
   - Real-time data on EV prices and charging infrastructure.

### **Methods**
- **Manual Extraction**:
  - Tabular data was extracted from official reports and converted into structured formats.
- **APIs**:
  - Collected live data on EV pricing and charging stations.
- **Surveys**:
  - Designed to capture the perspectives of diverse demographic groups.
- **Cross-Validation**:
  - Data was cross-referenced with multiple sources to ensure accuracy.

## How the Data Was Cleaned

### **Cleaning Steps**
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing income data was imputed using regional medians.
   - Gaps in time-series data (e.g., CO2 emissions) were filled using interpolation.
2. **Removing Duplicates**:
   - Duplicate rows were removed to avoid bias.
3. **Normalization**:
   - Skewed variables, such as EV prices, were normalized for consistent comparisons.
4. **Derived Metrics**:
   - **Affordability_Score**: Ratio of income to EV price.
   - **Policy_Impact**: Composite score of incentives and adoption rates.
