# Multilingual NLP MLOps Project

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/MLOps-Deployment/cia_logo.jpg" alt="Airflow Pipeline" width="180"/>  

This project showcases the development of a **multilingual NLP system** integrated with a full **MLOps pipeline**.
The goal was to create an **automated, scalable solution** capable of handling continuous retraining and deployment across multiple languages: **English, Dutch, Spanish, and German**.

The system includes a **tiered model strategy**:

* **Basic Tier** → In-house trained NLP model.
* **Intermediate Tier** → Multilingual fine-tuned transformer.
* **Premium Tier** → LLaMA-powered large language model.

Everything is fully automated — from **data ingestion** to **deployment and monitoring** — ensuring that models evolve continuously with new data and feedback.

##  Project Highlights

* Built a **multilingual NLP pipeline** for emotion and text classification.
* Designed a **three-tier model strategy** (basic, intermediate, premium).
* Integrated **continuous retraining** with user feedback loops.
* Supported **both cloud (Azure)** and **on-premises deployment**.
* Delivered a **demo dashboard** and visualized workflows through diagrams.
