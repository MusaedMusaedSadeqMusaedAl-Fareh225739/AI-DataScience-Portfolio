## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Football scouting is changing, and NACÂ Breda is at the forefront of that transformation. This project leverages data science and machine learning to support NACÂ Breda in identifying the most promising attacking players. By combining statistical rigor with football intelligence, we create a streamlined, efficient, and objective approach to player selection that aligns with the clubâ€™s goals and budget.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Size:** 16,535 player records  
- **Features:** 114 (numerical + categorical)  
- **Focus:** Player attributes, performance metrics, and potential contribution to NACÂ Breda  
- **Source:** Aggregated from reputable football databases, APIs, and public records  

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikitâ€‘learn  
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned, visualized, and analyzed key features  
- Studied player market values, age distribution, and position versatility  
- Assessed missing values, outliers, and anomalies  

#### Key Visuals

**Age vs. Market Value**

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Oneâ€‘hot encoded categorical features  
- Normalized numerical variables  
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistencies  

---

### 3. Model Development
- Selected **Logistic Regression** for its speed, interpretability, and binaryâ€‘classification performance  
- Trained to identify highâ€‘potential attackers based on selected performance metrics  

---

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1â€‘Score**  
- Hyperparameters optimized via grid search  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- **Correlation**: Strong positive relationship (0.90) between **Goals** and **Expected Goals (xG)**  
- **Experience Matters**: Players aged 31â€“40 logged the highest match participation  
- **Versatility**: C.Â Madueke emerged as a top multiposition attacking asset  
- **Market Value Outlier**: Liverpoolâ€™s financial metrics stood significantly above the rest

## ðŸ¤– Ethical Considerations

This project adheres to GDPR principles and ethical data use:  
- **Transparency** in data usage  
- **Fairness** in model selection  
- **Data Security** awareness  
- Commitment to diversity and integrity in football recruitment  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Strategic Recommendations

- **Attackers First**: Concentrate modeling efforts where data is richestâ€”attacking roles  
- **xG Consistency**: Scout for players with a track record of meeting or exceeding their xG  
- **Experience vs. Budget**: Balance seasoned veterans with financial constraints  
- **Tactical Flexibility**: Prioritize multiposition attackers like C.Â Madueke
