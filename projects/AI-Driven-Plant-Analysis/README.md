# AI-Driven Plant Analysis

<img align="left" src="./npec_logo.png" alt="NPEC Logo" width="120"/>  

**Client:** Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre (NPEC)

This project focused on **identifying and segmenting root structures** in Petri dish images using computer vision and **automating precise plant inoculation** with robotics.
By combining **U-Net-based semantic segmentation** with **robot control (PID & RL)**, the project delivered an **end-to-end AI-driven pipeline** for plant phenotyping.

---

## Project Highlights

* Developed a **U-Net model** achieving **F1 score = 0.85** for root mask prediction.
* Applied **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm** for precise measurement of **primary root length**.
* Automated inoculation using the **OT-2 robot**, comparing **PID controller vs. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.
* Delivered an **integrated pipeline** combining vision-based analysis with robotic automation.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Built expertise in **computer vision for agriculture** (semantic & instance segmentation).
* Designed a **precision robotic system** for plant inoculation (<1 mm accuracy).
* Conducted a **PID vs RL comparison**:

  * **PID** ‚Üí higher accuracy, stable (<1 mm error).
  * **RL** ‚Üí faster but slightly less accurate.
* Developed a **complete workflow**: preprocessing ‚Üí segmentation ‚Üí measurement ‚Üí robotic inoculation.

## Workflow & Process

The pipeline integrates **computer vision + robotics** in five major steps:

### 1. Original Petri Dish Image

Captured raw plant growth images. <img src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AI-Driven-Plant-Analysis/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20235948.png" width="400"/>

---

### 2. Petri Dish Extraction

Removed background noise, isolated the dish for cleaner analysis. <img src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AI-Driven-Plant-Analysis/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20235736.png" width="400"/>

---

### 3. Plant Instance Segmentation

Applied **U-Net** for semantic segmentation of plants (seeds, shoots, roots). <img src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AI-Driven-Plant-Analysis/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20235743.png" width="400"/>

---

### 4. Root Prediction

Predicted root structures and extracted **primary root length** using **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm**. <img src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AI-Driven-Plant-Analysis/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20235751.png" width="400"/>

---

### 5. Plant Inoculation

Integrated predictions with the **OT-2 robot** to inoculate plants at precise root tips.
Compared **PID controller** vs **Reinforcement Learning** for targeting accuracy. <img src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/AI-Driven-Plant-Analysis/Screenshot%202025-09-25%20235802.png" width="400"/>
