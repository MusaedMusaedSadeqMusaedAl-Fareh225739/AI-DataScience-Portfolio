This project, carried out in collaboration with Digiwerkplaats and SMEs in Brabant, investigates how small and medium-sized enterprises perceive and implement cybersecurity measures to protect customer data.
The research combines qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to provide actionable insights for businesses, policymakers, and academic partners.

Project Highlights

Problem: SMEs are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to limited resources, expertise, and regulatory awareness.

Goal: Understand how SMEs perceive cybersecurity risks and propose targeted solutions for improving resilience.

Collaboration: Conducted with Digiwerkplaats, supported by SMEs in Brabant.

Impact: Provides recommendations for policymakers, SME owners, and industry stakeholders.

Methodology

Qualitative Analysis

Semi-structured interviews with SME employees.

Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke framework) to uncover patterns in awareness, practices, and challenges.

Quantitative Analysis

Survey of 154 SME employees across sectors.

Likert-scale and multiple-choice questions analyzed with t-tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics.

Ethical Considerations

Informed consent, confidentiality, and anonymized responses ensured compliance with research ethics.

Key Findings

Confidence Gaps: Larger SMEs in IT/Finance report higher confidence, while smaller SMEs (e.g., agriculture, PR) show weaker preparedness.

Financial Constraints: Many SMEs lack budgets for cybersecurity staff or advanced tools.

Reliance on Outsourcing: Smaller SMEs often depend on external providers, raising issues of trust and data control.

Awareness Gaps: Employees often lack understanding of policy consequences despite valuing cybersecurity.

Recommendations

Sector-Specific Guidelines: Tailor cybersecurity strategies to industry needs instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.

Financial Incentives: Provide grants or tax benefits for SMEs investing in cybersecurity.

Public-Private Partnerships: Connect SMEs with larger corporations to share tools, training, and expertise.

Mandatory Training: Introduce practical cybersecurity training programs to close awareness gaps.

Simplified Compliance: Develop easier-to-follow frameworks for GDPR and related regulations.

My Role in the Project

Acted as team researcher and analyst.

Contributed to survey design and data collection with Digiwerkplaats SMEs.

Led statistical analysis (t-tests, chi-square, EDA).

Co-authored the policy paper and poster for academic dissemination.

Ensured the final recommendations were actionable and aligned with SME constraints.
