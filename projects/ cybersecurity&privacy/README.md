<img align="left" src="https://github.com/MusaedMusaedSadeqMusaedAl-Fareh225739/AI-DataScience-Portfolio/blob/main/projects/%20cybersecurity%26privacy/digiweerkplats_mkb_logo.png" alt="Digiwerkplaats Logo" width="120"/>

This project, carried out in collaboration with **Digiwerkplaats** and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Brabant, explores how SMEs perceive, implement, and struggle with cybersecurity measures.  
The study combines qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to provide evidence-based insights and actionable recommendations for businesses, policymakers, and academic partners.

##  Project Highlights
- **Problem**: SMEs are disproportionately vulnerable to cyberattacks due to limited budgets, low expertise, and a lack of regulatory clarity.  
- **Goal**: Investigate how SMEs perceive cybersecurity risks and propose realistic, tailored solutions.  
- **Collaboration**: Joint initiative with **Digiwerkplaats Brabant**, supported by multiple SMEs across industries.  
- **Impact**: Delivered **policy recommendations**, a **research poster**, and a **policy paper** to guide SME cybersecurity practices.

##  Methodology

### **Qualitative Analysis**
- Conducted **semi-structured interviews** with SME employees from diverse industries.  
- Applied the **Braun & Clarke thematic analysis framework** to uncover recurring themes in awareness, practices, and challenges.  

### **Quantitative Analysis**
- Surveyed **154 SME employees** across multiple sectors.  
- Designed **Likert-scale and multiple-choice questions**.  
- Analyzed results with:
  - **T-tests** ‚Üí for confidence level differences.  
  - **Chi-square tests** ‚Üí for categorical associations.  
  - **Descriptive statistics & EDA** ‚Üí to identify key patterns.  

### **Ethical Considerations**
- All participants gave **informed consent**.  
- Responses were **confidential and anonymized**.  
- Research followed academic **ethical compliance standards** (GDPR alignment).  

---

##  Key Findings
- **Confidence Gaps**: Larger SMEs (e.g., IT, Finance) show higher confidence, while smaller SMEs (e.g., Agriculture, PR) remain underprepared.  
- **Financial Constraints**: Most SMEs cannot afford dedicated cybersecurity staff or advanced tools.  
- **Reliance on Outsourcing**: Smaller firms outsource IT security ‚Üí raising **trust** and **data control** issues.  
- **Awareness Gaps**: Employees value cybersecurity but lack understanding of **policy/regulation consequences**.

##  Recommendations
1. **Sector-Specific Guidelines** ‚Üí Tailored strategies per industry instead of a one-size-fits-all model.  
2. **Financial Incentives** ‚Üí Grants, tax reliefs, or subsidies for SMEs investing in security.  
3. **Public-Private Partnerships** ‚Üí Connect SMEs with larger firms for access to training and shared tools.  
4. **Mandatory Training** ‚Üí Introduce regular **practical cybersecurity training** for SME employees.  
5. **Simplified Compliance** ‚Üí Develop easy-to-follow frameworks for **GDPR** and related policies.
